###`19 March 2020`

The purpose of this blog is to document my learning on the following topics

- Linux Security
- Linux Malware Analysis
- Reverse Engineering

Reverse Engineering is a broad field which requires a lot of knowledge about diverse areas.
 Since the platform of choice for us is Linux we will name tools specific to Linux.

- OS Internals - Linux, kernel, libc
- File Formats - ELF, others
- Debuggers - gdb, crash, kdb
- Compilers - gcc, llvm
- Linkers - ld
- Assembler - as
- Machine architecture - x86, ARM
- Assembly Language - 32-bit/64-bit, Intel/ATT syntax
- General system tools - strace, ltrace, lsof, proc, ps etc
- Binary Analysis tools - radare2, objdump, readelf, hexdump
- Scripting - bash, Python
- Languages - C, C++, Other compiled languages
- Networking/Web - Internet, TCP/IP, HTTP[S], DNS, tshark
- Forensics - Filesystem, Memory, Network


We also have to learn about malicious programs and techniques that they use often

- Packer/Unpackers - upx, others
- Ransomware - encryption/decryption
- Code Obfuscation 
- Anti-reversing
